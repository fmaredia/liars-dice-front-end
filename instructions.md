1. Create a game with 5 dice ceiling
2. Players will go in order:
   Make a bet of certain dice
   Push dice to the middle to prevent their re-roll
   Reroll & add the dice back to their dice array

   or 
   Challenge the previous claim (checks all dice)
     if the player's challenge is wrong, they lose a die
     if the player's challenge is right, the liar loses a die

3. Player is ejected from player roll if they have no die
4. Game ends when there is only one player left, prompt for a new game
